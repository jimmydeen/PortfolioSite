    <p>
        Hey! I'm Joong Do Chiang, but most people call me JD. I am currently
        a Bachelor's of Advanced Computer Science (Honours) student at Monash University
        in Melbourne, Victoria. 
        I love all things tech and hope to be working in the forefront of the field 
        in the years to come.
